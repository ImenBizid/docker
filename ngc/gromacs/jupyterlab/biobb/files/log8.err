On host 8afc530b9665 2 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:1,PP:1
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 4 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  5.00000e+02
   Number of steps    =         5000

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Steepest Descents converged to Fmax < 500 in 2297 steps
Potential Energy  = -6.0152525e+05
Maximum force     =  4.2442383e+02 on atom 1958
