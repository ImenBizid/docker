Reading file 1AKI_gppmd.tpr, VERSION 2020.2-dev-20200430-5e78835-unknown (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.167

On host 8afc530b9665 2 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:1,PP:1
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 4 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


NOTE: DLB will not turn on during the first phase of PME tuning
starting mdrun 'Protein in water'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

NOTE: DLB can now turn on, when beneficial

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 1.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 52%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.5%.
